# ATM
Build a basic ATM app that allows a user to:

Create a username
Create a password
Log in with their username/password (re-prompting them if they enter the wrong credentials)
See a menu with options to:

view their balance (this can be hardcoded)
change their username or password
deposit funds (add to current balance)
withdraw funds (remove funds from current balance)
logout
Bonus:
Create an actual frontend for this app inside of index.html :eyes:
